## 🛠️ Solution

### ✔️ Step 1 — Download the file  
The challenge gives you a file named `flag`.

### ✔️ Step 2 — Use the `cat` command  
In your terminal (or picoCTF Webshell), run:

```bash
$ cat flag
````

### ✔️ Step 3 — Read the output

The command directly prints the flag to your screen.

Example output:

```
picoCTF{FLAG}
```

That’s it — no tricks, no encoding, just practicing reading a file in Linux.

## 📚 What We Learned

### 🐱 What is `cat`?

`cat` is a basic Linux command used to **display the contents of a file**.

It is often used in CTFs to quickly inspect text files, flags, scripts, or hidden notes.

Example:

```bash
cat filename.txt
```

## 🧠 Self‑Reflection

This challenge was simple but important. It reminded me that:

* Not every challenge requires hacking — sometimes the answer is right in front of you.
* Knowing basic Linux commands is essential in every CTF and cybersecurity job.
* This was a confidence booster and a warm-up before the harder challenges.

I also learned that being comfortable with the terminal makes everything faster and more efficient during competitions.
