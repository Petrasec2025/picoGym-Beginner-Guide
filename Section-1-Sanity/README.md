## 💡 What is Netcat?
**Netcat**, often called `nc`, is like a Swiss Army knife for network connections. It can:  
- Connect to remote computers over TCP or UDP  
- Send and receive data  
- Act as a simple server or client  

Example usage:
```bash
# Connect to a remote machine on port 1234
nc 192.168.1.10 1234

# Start a simple server on port 5555
nc -lvp 5555
````

Netcat is very useful for testing services, transferring files, or creating quick connections during CTF challenges.
